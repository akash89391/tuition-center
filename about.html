                For KCC’s online classes, focus on delivering a structured curriculum through live interactive sessions
                using platforms like Zoom or Google Meet. Ensure that classes are engaging with the use of digital tools
                like virtual whiteboards, screen sharing, and educational videos. Provide students with digital notes,
                recorded sessions, and regular assignments for self-paced learning. Keep batch sizes small for
                personalized attention, and offer flexible schedules. Use regular assessments and feedback to track
                progress, and communicate with parents through virtual meetings. Promote the classes via social media,
                local networks, and referrals, while ensuring competitive pricing and flexible payment options.
