    <p><i>Tuition in education refers to the fees charged by educational institutions for providing teaching and
        instructional services, and it varies widely based on factors such as the type of institution (public or
        private), level of education, location, and program of study. Public institutions often offer lower tuition
        rates due to government funding, while private institutions typically charge more. Higher levels of education,
        such as university and postgraduate programs, usually have higher tuition, with certain fields like medicine,
        engineering, and law being particularly expensive. Tuition fees also vary for domestic and international
        students, with the latter often facing higher costs. In addition to institutional fees, many students seek
        supplementary private tuition to improve in specific subjects. While some countries heavily subsidize education
        or offer free university programs, others, like the U.S., have high tuition costs, raising concerns about
        affordability and student debt. To help students manage these costs, scholarships, financial aid, and government
        loans are often available. The increasing tuition fees have sparked debates about educational access and equity,
        as well as the relationship between tuition prices and the quality of education. Although prestigious
        institutions may charge more, higher fees don't necessarily guarantee better educational outcomes, and movements
        advocating for free education continue to challenge the existing models, aiming to make education more
        accessible to all.</i></p>
